# FLARE

**FLARE** is a runtime verification tool designed to generate tamper-evident, immutable audit logs for system behavior during execution. It ensures that monitored systems remain compliant with regulatory and forensic requirements by embedding logging and monitoring directly into the runtime environment.

---

## Key Features

- **Monitors Runtime Behavior**  
  Monitors and flags events during execution using user-defined specifications through the [Larva](https://github.com/ccol002/larva-rv-tool) scripting language.

- **Generates Audit Trails**  
  Automatically logs all monitored events to an append-only file structure suitable for audit via [SealFS](https://github.com/ccol002/sealfs).

- **Ensures Tamper-Evident Logging**  
  Produces logs that cannot be altered in any way without detection, even if the attacker has root privileges.

- **Supports Risk-Driven Logging Granularity**  
  Enables selective logging of relevant data based on risk assessments or regulatory requirements, minimizing overhead while maintaining forensic utility.

- **Suitable for Forensic Nodes**  
  Implements the core features required of a forensic node:
  - Completeness of logged data
  - Resistance to tampering
  - Efficient and timely access to logs

- **Suitable for Real-Time Systems**  
  Designed for low-latency environment, logs are processed asynchronously to avoid blocking time-sensitive operations.

## Output

- Structured logs with cryptographic protection for every monitored event
- Binary (yes/no) verification of integrity using offline tools
- Log segmentation and customizable detail level based on monitoring rules
- Optional hooks to notify operators or take corrective actions on property violations

## Example Use Cases

- **Autonomous UAVs**  
  Enforces compliance with airspace, safety, and signal integrity rules, and produces logs for post-flight review and certification.
  A simulated drone example is available in [`Example`](./Example/).
  
- **AI Systems in Regulated Sectors**  
  Could tracks model inputs/outputs and ensure that runtime behavior aligns with predefined risk control properties.

- **Safety-Critical Systems**  
  May be used to enable real-time detection and logging of violations in industrial control systems, robotics, and embedded platforms.

## Status

FLARE is research-grade software developed to bridge formal methods and regulatory needs in secure software systems. It has been tested on UAVs and is adaptable to a broad range of real-time, safety-critical, and high-assurance platforms.

See [`UserManual.md`](./UserManual.md) for setup and integration instructions.
